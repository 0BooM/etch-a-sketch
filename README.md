# etch-a-sketch
This project was about creating a site with a canvas. Canvas is created with little squares on which you should be able to ,,paint" after hovering over them. It is a project from TOP Foundations.

CONCLUSION AFTER MAKING IT:
I definitely learned more about selecting different tags, classes, id's by querySelector, getElementById, etc.. I also googled some informations to make my code work or when I had a problem why my code doesn't run correctly, so I think that my ability to look for answers online got better. Another fact is that I used forEach iteration which wasn't really understood by me, now I'm sure that it is easier for me to work on forEach iteration, but I know that I need to work on it much more.

This project really caused me some trouble as I wanted to ,,upgrade" it and adding some other functionalities (Yeaaa, I resigned for them, but I want to comeback to them to as soon as I will learn more javascript), thus it made me use uncle google to find answers and I found some of them and learned some new stuff to use in my future projects. Etch-a-sketch made me feel more comfortable in JavaScript and I'm pretty sure that when I will be further in TOP my confidence will grow.
